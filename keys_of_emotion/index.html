      <p>In a time long before ours, a creature of whimsy decided to hide something precious. It never spoke of what it was, but only of what it was worth. And to hear the creature speak of it, it was worth much.</p>
    </page>

    <page id="start" class="first">
      <p>This is the story your mother told you as a child. She named the creature <i>Starmarsh</i> and used this story to distract you in moments of tantrum. You know this now, a parent yourself, and keenly aware of the whims of children. But Starmarsh faded from your memory as you aged...until today, <turn to="starmarsh">as you were walking the shortcut through the woods.</turn></p>
    </page>

    <page id="starmarsh">
      <p>As you are waling along the trail, a small person approaches you. The person walks right to you, <interact with="starmarsh_meet">blocking your path</interact>.</p>
    </page>

    <page id="town">
      <p>You approach your usual tea shop, but right where the entrance door usually is, there is instead another door. It is made of heavy wood. You try opening it, but it is locked shut. </p>
      {{? story.isInInventory('key_happy') }}
        <p></p>
      {{??}}
        <p>Over to the side, you hear someone enter the tea shop and you realize that the shop door has moved. Do you <turn to="">ignore this bizarre situation and go get some tea</turn> or do you <turn to="starmarsh">go back to the woods and find that strange person</turn>?</p>
      {{?}}
    </page>

    <page id="ended_before_it_even_starts">
      <p>Thank you, but I think you have mistaken me for someone else.</p>
      <p>You continue down the path, wondering for a moment who that strange person was. By the time you get to the market, you've already forgotten him.</p>
