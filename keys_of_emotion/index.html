      <p>In a time long before ours, a creature of whimsy decided to hide something precious. It never spoke of what it was, but only of what it was worth. And to hear the creature speak of it, it was worth much.</p>

      <p>This is the story your mother told you as a child. She named the creature <i>Starmarsh</i> and used this story to distract you in moments of tantrum. You know this now, a parent yourself, and keenly aware of the whims of children. But Starmarsh faded from your memory as you aged...until today, <turn to="starmarsh">as you were walking the shortcut through the woods.</turn></p>

      <p>You approach your usual tea shop, but right where the entrance door usually is, there is instead a new and strange <interact with="door" id="doorInteraction">door</interact>.
